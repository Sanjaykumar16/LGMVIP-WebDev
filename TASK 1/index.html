                              Unlimited downloads - no holds and eBooks stay on a device for 8 weeks.
                              No cost - free to readers through qualifying organizations and no late fees.
                              eBooks are delivered almost instantaneously. You can purchase, download, and start reading them within minutes, without leaving your chair. You don’t have to go to a bookstore to buy them, nor wait for them for days, weeks and sometimes more to arrive in the mail.

                               No trees are required to manufacture paper for the pages of eBooks.
                              
                               When you need certain information, you can get it immediately, by downloading an eBook.
                              
                               Many eBooks are sold nowadays with bonuses, which you usually do not get with a printed book. This adds value to your purchase.
                              
                             eBooks take up less space. You practically don’t need any space to store them. You don’t need a library or a room for them. You can store hundreds and thousands of eBooks on your computer or reading device.
